## Bandits strategies
*Work done during the course of Thomas Bonald and Pierre Gaillard at Telecom Paris.*

Implementation and test of the performance of some usual bandit algorithms.

* **ùúÄ -greedy**
* **adaptive greedy**
* **UCB**
* **Thompson sampling**

### 1. [Bandits algorithms](./bandits_strategies/stochastic-bandits/bandits_algorithms.ipynb)
Implementation of the above algorithms in a bandit environment (Bernouilli and Gaussian rewards).

### 2. [Stochastic bandits](./bandits_strategies/stochastic-bandits/lab-stochastic-bandits.ipynb)
Look at the regret and precision of these algorithms, with some statistics.

### 3. [Adversarial bandits](./bandits_strategies/adversarial-bandits/Adversarial_bandits.ipynb)
Implementation of EXP3 algorithm for simple player vs adversary game.
